# drug_sentiment_analysis

### This project utilizes several well-known sentiment analysis tools:

NLTK VADER<br>
huggingface (RoBERTa)<br>
spaCY<br><br>

We compare the sentiment analysis tools based on how well they align with the 1-10 rating scores, select the best model, and answer questions about the dataset based on our findings.<br><br>
